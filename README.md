# Credit-Card-Default-Risk-Analysis
Credit risk has traditionally been the greatest risk among all the risks that the banking and credit
card industry are facing, and it is usually the one requiring the most capital. This can be proven
by industry business reports and statistical data. For example, “The Federal Reserve Bank of
New York measures credit card delinquencies based on the percent of balances that are at least
90 days late. For the third quarter of 2019, that rate was about 8%, about the same level as in
the previous quarter.” Thus, assessing, detecting and managing default risk is the key factor in

generating revenue and reducing loss for the banking and credit card industry.
Despite machine learning and big data have been adopted by the banking industry, the current
applications are mainly focused on credit score predicting. The disadvantage of heavily relying
on credit score is banks would miss valuable customers who come from countries that are
traditionally underbanked with no credit history or new immigrants who have repaying power but
lack credit history. According to a literature review report on analyzing credit risk using machine
and deep learning models, “credit risk management problems researched have been around
credit scoring; it would go a long way to research how machine learning can be applied to
quantitative areas for better computations of credit risk exposure by predicting probabilities of
default.”

Problem understanding:
A Credit Card company needs to improve the ability to predict whether or not its customer will default, as well as recognise the factors that influence this probability and analyse the risk associated with the payment of credit card bills by customers.
